I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://brown.edu/) and a member of the [Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) group. I am also an affiliate faculty at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and the chair of [WiGRAPH](https://www.wigraph.org/).

My research group creates design tools and systems that will revolutionize how we build physical artifacts. A central challenge for design tools in manufacturing is the need to simultaneously nurture the creative ability to conceive novel designs and the analytical capacity to critically evaluate and optimize functionality and production. My group tackles this challenge through innovative solutions that are grounded in the fundamentals of geometry processing and combine insights from machine learning and programming languages.

My research has been recognized by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2024-Fellows), [MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 award](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovator/adriana-schulz/), an NSF CAREER award, and faculty awards from Google, Amazon, and Intel, among others. I am honored to receive the [2024 ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award](https://www.siggraph.org/awards/significant-new-researcher-award/2024).

## Bio

I grew up in Brazil, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from [UFRJ](http://www.impa.br/) and a Master's in Mathematics from [IMPA](http://www.impa.br/). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [MIT](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in 2018. After that, I spent several wonderful years at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and was later promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. I joined [Brown University](https://brown.edu) in 2025.
